This theme is dumb and doesn't work well with WordPress' flexibility. Ignore everything written below. [Timber](https://upstatement.com/timber/) is great, however, and you should always use it on WordPress projects!

There might be some useful snippets in this theme but it isn't really suitable for production use as is.
